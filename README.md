# üìù NoteMaster with FastAPI

NoteMaster is a powerful and user-friendly note-taking application built using FastAPI and Streamlit. It allows users to create, manage, and analyze their notes efficiently. The app also provides AI-generated questions to help users retain information effectively.
The purpose of this app is to help users learn actively using AI in a simple but efficient way but also to learn from each and other insights.
The subjects that one user create with the question and answers associated aren't private so as allow other users to learn that also and then improve their knowledge somehow with the help of other users also.
This is one of the first open-collaborative learning platform.
